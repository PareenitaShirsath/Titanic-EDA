## 🌟 About the Task

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech** 🎓.  
The goal of **Task-02** was to perform:

> 🧹 Data Cleaning + 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
> ...on the world-famous **Titanic dataset** 🚢

## 📚 Dataset

- 📁 Dataset: [Kaggle Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- 🎯 Objective: Find patterns between features and **survival**

## 📊 EDA Visualizations

Here are some of the beautiful and insightful charts I created:

| Visualization 📈      | Description 💡                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Survival Count     | How many passengers survived/did not     |
| ✅ Gender vs Survival | Females had higher survival rate 💁‍♀️     |
| ✅ Class vs Survival  | 1st Class passengers survived more 🎩     |
| ✅ Age Distribution   | Children and young adults survived more 👶 |
| ✅ Correlation Heatmap| Fare & Pclass showed correlation with survival 🔍 |
